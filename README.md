## Game Description 🕹️
### **RushBomb**:
> A **classic TNT Tag minigame** where the player holding the **bomb** when **time runs out** will **die**. Pass the bomb to someone else **before the timer ends** to survive!

### **GoldenBomb**:
> A **fast-paced minigame** where several **Golden Bombs** are in play. Players can **steal** Golden Bombs from each other, and when the game ends, anyone **without a Golden Bomb** is eliminated.

### **PacTNTMan**:
> A **thrilling minigame** where an admin **disguised as Pacman** hands a **TNT** to a player. The player must **pass it within 30 seconds** or **explode**.

### **KothTNT**:
> In this minigame, players who carry the **bomb** gain **1 point every second**. When **time runs out**, those with the **lowest scores** are **eliminated**.

And others...
