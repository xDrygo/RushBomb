# RushBomb 🧨

## Introduction 📋
**RushBomb** is a **Minecraft event** that explores various mechanics based on the classic **TNT Tag**, brought to you by **Turtle Club** — an event in which I participated by developing games such as **GoldenBomb**, **PacTNTMan**, and **TNT Tag**.

## Game Description 🕹️
### **GoldenBomb**:
> A **fast-paced minigame** where several **Golden Bombs** are in play. Players can **steal** Golden Bombs from each other, and when the game ends, anyone **without a Golden Bomb** is eliminated.

### **PacTNTMan**:
> A **thrilling minigame** where an admin **disguised as Pacman** hands a **TNT** to a player. The player must **pass it within 30 seconds** or **explode**.

And others...
